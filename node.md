Thread communication can be as simple as sharing a variable or object bearing in mind that synchronization is required. Interprocess communication is a bit harder and much slower since processes are separated and cannot intervene. For this type of communication you can use named pipes, memory mapped files, msmq, TCP, WCF, file system and other.
